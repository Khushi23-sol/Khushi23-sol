# Hi, I'm Khushi Solanki 👋

I am a Mechanical Engineering student (Robotics Honours) from Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai.

I am interested in mechanical design, robotics systems, prototyping, and learning by building and experimenting. I enjoy working on engineering projects that involve CAD design, basic electronics, and system-level thinking.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools
- CAD: SolidWorks, AutoCAD (part modeling, assemblies, drawings)
- Manufacturing: CNC Lathe & Turning (basic hands-on exposure)
- Robotics & IoT: Basics of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers
- Analysis: Engineering drawings, basic design validation
- Tools: MATLAB (basics), ANSYS (introductory exposure)

## 🛠️ Projects
I have worked on academic and exploratory projects involving:
- Mechanical design and CAD modeling
- Concept-level robotics and system design
- Research-oriented project planning and documentation

(Some projects are at design and research stage and are documented here.)

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
- Prototyping methods
- Practical robotics system integration
- Improving CAD and documentation skills
